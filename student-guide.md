# Student Guide: Corrections Facility Change Management Simulation

## Overview

In this simulation, you will take on the role of a public health nurse attempting to implement a flu vaccination program in a county corrections facility. You will meet with Sam Richards, the Operations Manager, who is known for being resistant to change. Your goal is to persuade Sam to support your vaccination program despite his objections and resistance.

## Learning Objectives

Through this simulation, you will practice:

1. Applying change management principles in a challenging healthcare setting
2. Developing strategies to address resistance from stakeholders
3. Using effective communication techniques in difficult conversations
4. Problem-solving in real-time when faced with objections
5. Building relationships with resistant stakeholders

## Preparation

Before starting the simulation, prepare by:

1. **Reviewing Change Management Theories**:
   - Kotter's 8-Step Change Model
   - Lewin's Change Management Model
   - The ADKAR Model

2. **Researching Corrections Healthcare**:
   - CDC guidelines for correctional healthcare settings
   - Common challenges in implementing healthcare programs in corrections
   - Security and operational considerations in corrections facilities

3. **Developing Your Approach**:
   - Create a brief implementation plan for the flu vaccination program
   - Anticipate potential objections and prepare responses
   - Consider the key benefits from the corrections facility's perspective

4. **Preparing Your Materials**:
   - Statistics on flu outbreaks in corrections settings
   - Examples of successful implementations in similar facilities
   - Cost-benefit analysis
   - Implementation timeline

## Tips for Success

1. **Build Rapport**: Begin by establishing a connection before diving into your proposal.

2. **Listen Actively**: Pay attention to Sam's specific concerns and address them directly.

3. **Focus on Benefits**: Emphasize how the program benefits the facility, not just the incarcerated individuals.

4. **Address Root Concerns**: Look for the underlying issues behind stated objections.

5. **Be Flexible**: Be prepared to modify your approach based on Sam's feedback.

6. **Stay Professional**: Maintain composure even when faced with dismissive or skeptical responses.

7. **Find Common Ground**: Identify shared goals and build from there.

8. **Use Data Strategically**: Reference statistics and success stories, but don't overwhelm with numbers.

9. **Seek Incremental Wins**: If full implementation seems unlikely, try to secure smaller commitments.

10. **Close with Next Steps**: End with clear action items and follow-up plans.

## Simulation Instructions

1. Access the simulation using the URL and password provided by your instructor.

2. Review the scenario introduction screen carefully.

   - Demonstrating respect for the manager's perspective

5. **Overall Effectiveness** (15%):
   - Progress made with the resistant manager
   - Securing concrete next steps or commitments

## Self-Reflection Questions

After completing the simulation, consider:

1. What aspects of the interaction were most challenging for you?

2. Which of Sam's objections were most difficult to address?

3. What would you do differently if you could repeat the interaction?

4. What did you learn about yourself as a change agent?

5. How did your preparation help or hinder your performance?

6. What specific techniques were most effective in addressing the resistance you encountered?

7. At what point did you feel most frustrated, and how did you manage that emotion?

8. How will you apply what you learned in future change management situations?

## Submission Instructions

1. Download your conversation transcript by clicking the "Download Transcript" button.

2. Complete the self-reflection questions in a separate document.

3. Submit both your transcript and self-reflection to the assignment portal by the due date.

4. Be prepared to discuss your experience in the next class session.

Good luck! Remember that navigating resistance is a skill that develops with practice, and this simulation provides a safe environment to build that skill.
